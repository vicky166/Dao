# Dao

## This Solidity smart contract implements a decentralized proposal and voting system on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract allows authorized users to create proposals and lets eligible voters cast their votes on them. Each proposal has a unique identifier, title, description, and a defined voting period during which votes can be cast. The contract ensures transparency and integrity by maintaining a record of each vote and preventing users from voting multiple times on the same proposal.


# key features

## Key features of the contract include the ability for users to propose new ideas and changes, and for voters to express their approval or disapproval through a simple "Yes" or "No" voting mechanism. The contract is integrated with a token system (MyToken) to manage user permissions, ensuring only eligible individuals can create proposals and vote. Additionally, the contract provides functions to retrieve the current list of proposals and their voting status, enabling participants to stay informed about ongoing governance activities.
